[Listen to episode 110 of Hemispheric Views](https://listen.hemisphericviews.com/110)

### Adding your albums

This is not a fun process but it's what we have.

Step one: Write a blog post with your favourite albums

**If you're not comfortable with git** 

- Open an issue here or [toot @robb](https://social.lol/@robb) with a link to your post and he'll add it when he has time

**If you're familiar with git:**

1. Clone the repo
2. Add the album art to `assets/covers` with a unique-ish name
3. Add your album(s) to `_data/albums.js` with your name, link to your post, and the album details
4. Open a pull request
